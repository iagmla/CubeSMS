# CubeSMS

*** Use at your own risk

CubeSMS is an Android APK compiled using an ancient version of Android but still seems to work. It uses the Cube90 cipher and may be used to send messages to someone using preshared keys. Simply copy the received message into the app and press the decrypt button. To send, type the phone number, type your message, type the key and press send.
